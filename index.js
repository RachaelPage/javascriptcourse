//Create at least 2 different classes 

cameraview = class {

//create several instances for these classes 

blue_lagoon = new artwork(image1.jpg, 'Blue Lagoon', 100,100, 1500)

bathroom = new cameraview('Bathroomimage', 2)
bedroom = new cameraview('Bedroomimage', 3)
kitchen = new cameraview('Kitchenimage', 2.5)

//create at least 3 different interactions between said classes
//a cameraview has infinite different image feeds because it's live-feed
//a User can swipe left or right to see a new artwork in the cameraview
//each artwork can be bought, shared, commented on, added to a virtual collection and the user can follow the artist

bathroom = new cameraview('Blue Lagoon in bathroom')
bedroom = new cameraview('Red Sunset in bedroom')
kitchen = new cameraview('Pink Drinks in kitchen')
